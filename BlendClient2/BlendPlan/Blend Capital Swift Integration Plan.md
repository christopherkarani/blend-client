# Blend Capital Swift Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive integration plan for creating a Swift module that interfaces with the Blend Capital protocol. The module is designed to be easily dropped into existing Swift applications, providing functionality to retrieve pool statistics, manage user accounts, and handle deposits and withdrawals.

The integration plan is based on extensive research of the Blend Capital documentation, analysis of the Stellar iOS SDK, and validation against the Blend protocol's contract requirements. The resulting design follows Swift best practices, leveraging protocols, generics, and the Combine framework for reactive programming.

## Integration Components

The integration plan consists of the following components:

1. **Architecture Design**: A detailed architecture for the Swift module, including core design principles, module structure, and component interactions.
2. **API Design**: Comprehensive API specifications for pool statistics retrieval and account management.
3. **Fund Management Logic**: Detailed implementation of deposit and withdrawal logic, including contract interaction patterns.
4. **Validation**: Thorough validation of the module against Blend Capital contract requirements and protocol documentation.

## Key Features

The Swift module provides the following key features:

- **Pool Statistics**: Retrieve comprehensive statistics about Blend Capital lending pools, including current yield, supplied amount, borrowed amount, and backstop amount.
- **Account Management**: Access user account information, including positions, collateral, borrowing, and yield earned.
- **Fund Management**: Deposit and withdraw funds, manage collateral, and handle borrowing and repayment.
- **Caching**: Efficient caching mechanisms to reduce network calls and improve performance.
- **Network Flexibility**: Support for both testnet and mainnet environments with easy switching.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with clear error messages.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Protocol-Oriented Design**: Interfaces are defined as protocols, allowing for easy mocking and testing.
2. **Functional Programming**: Pure functions are used where possible, with clear separation of data transformation and side effects.
3. **Reactive Programming**: Combine framework is used for asynchronous operations and data streams.
4. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be independent and reusable.
5. **Testability**: The architecture facilitates unit testing through dependency injection and protocol abstractions.

## Integration Steps

To integrate the Blend Capital Swift module into an existing application:

1. **Add Dependencies**: Add the module to your project using Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods, or Carthage.
2. **Configure the Module**: Initialize the module with your preferred configuration (testnet/mainnet, caching settings, etc.).
3. **Implement Pool Statistics**: Use the provided API to retrieve and display pool statistics.
4. **Implement Account Management**: Use the provided API to retrieve and display user account information.
5. **Implement Fund Management**: Use the provided API to handle deposits, withdrawals, and other fund management operations.

## Code Examples

### Configuration

```swift
// Get the shared instance of BlendCapital
let blendCapital = BlendCapital.shared

// Configure for testnet
blendCapital.configure(with: BlendConfiguration(environment: .testnet))
```

### Retrieving Pool Statistics

```swift
// Retrieve statistics for a specific pool
blendCapital.getPoolStats(id: "pool123")
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            switch completion {
            case .finished:
                print("Successfully retrieved pool stats")
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Error retrieving pool stats: \(error)")
            }
        },
        receiveValue: { stats in
            print("Pool Stats:")
            print("Lending APY: \(stats.lendingAPY)%")
            print("Borrowing APY: \(stats.borrowingAPY)%")
            print("Utilization Rate: \(stats.utilizationRate * 100)%")
            print("Total Supplied: $\(stats.totalSupplied)")
            print("Total Borrowed: $\(stats.totalBorrowed)")
            print("Backstop Amount: $\(stats.backstopAmount)")
        }
    )
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

### Depositing Funds

```swift
// Deposit 100 USDC to a pool
blendCapital.deposit(
    accountId: "GACVHHIZGSRWXGN...",
    poolId: "pool123",
    assetId: "USDC",
    amount: 100
)
.receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
.sink(
    receiveCompletion: { completion in
        switch completion {
        case .finished:
            print("Successfully deposited funds")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error depositing funds: \(error)")
        }
    },
    receiveValue: { result in
        print("Transaction Hash: \(result.transactionHash)")
        print("Ledger: \(result.ledger)")
        print("Created At: \(result.createdAt)")
    }
)
.store(in: &cancellables)
```

## Testing Strategy

The module is designed to be easily testable through:

1. **Protocol Abstractions**: All components are defined as protocols, allowing for easy mocking.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected, allowing for easy substitution in tests.
3. **Unit Tests**: Each component can be tested in isolation.
4. **Integration Tests**: The module can be tested against the Blend Capital testnet.
